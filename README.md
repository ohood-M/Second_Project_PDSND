# Project 2
This project is a part of Programming For Data Science Using Python Nanodegree at udacity.

### Overview
In this project, the student make a use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Where they write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also, write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Project Submission
Project include:
* A **bikeshare.py** file which set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal. The users is asked multiple questions and based on their answer the dataset will be filtered, Then it will show a descriptive statistics upon the desired city and timeframe. In addition it also display a raw data upon user request.

### Database

* washington.csv
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv

### Software requirements
